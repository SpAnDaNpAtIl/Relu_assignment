My assignment incldues 2 python files
main.py is responsible for sending requests to amazon links and storing output as json
I went with requests library for this, added headers to avoid errors. Later for authorized requests with status code 200, I used bs4 inbuilt function find and find_all to get my data
I opened few 200 status code links myself, saw patterns in the html elements of webpages and targetted those fixed specific ids and classes for getting my values
For image url, amazon servers had a pattern for saving same image in different resolutions, I spotted it and fixed the URL link to get URL of better quality image
For price, I spotted that out of 4(i checked unique countries from the DB) countries, 2 had same span class and other 2 had same span class, so used try except

Time elapsed is 405.91859912872314s for entire code
After repeatedly testing the code, amazon servers started blocking access to few URLs, so json file contents will keep changing after everytime code is run again. I request to run code
first and then see the json file as current json file in github repo has very less data for now.
